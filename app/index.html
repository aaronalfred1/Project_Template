    <h2>Design Values</h2>
    <p>Wattpad is a social product centered around people who escape, connect, and express themselves through stories. Our design principles bring the experience to life and underpin everything we do as a product team. They shape the way our product looks, the way it feels, and how we should approach our design challenges.</p>

    <h3>Friendly/Positive/Supportive</h3>
    <p>In order to establish lasting relationships, our experience should have a human touch that makes it feel honest and personal. We should be welcoming and approachable, connecting with people in a positive, encouraging, and supportive voice.</p>

    <h3>Diverse</h3>
    <p>We are international and universal. We welcome people from all walks of life. Our product is for everyone: from every culture, every belief, every language, and at every stage of life.</p>

    <h3>Accessible</h3>
    <p>We’re designing for people, not screens. Wattpad is used by millions across the world with ranging connectivity, on all manner of devices. Our product should remain open and free to access at any time, from any place.</p>

     <h3>Trusted</h3>
    <p>At Wattpad we value our users’ privacy and the trust they put in us. We need to ensure people feel both emotionally and physically safe. We should always be transparent about what’s happening and why. Our product should provide a safe space where users can pursue the stories they want to read and express themselves without fear.</p>

     <h3>Personal</h3>
    <p>Within the vast Wattpad community, each experience should be shaped by the users unique collection of interests. We seek to build a product that showcases each user’s individuality. We acknowledge our users as individuals and celebrate their accomplishments.</p>

    <h3>Entertaining/Playful/Fun</h3>
    <p>Our aim is to provide a relaxed and playful environment that inspires creativity and offers individuals the freedom to express themselves. We should help users engage and interact so that the experiences we create are fun, absorbing, and rewarding.</p>


  <h3>Simple</h3>
    <p>We do the hard work to make sure that using our product is simple. By understanding user needs, we deliver exactly what they expect.</p>


    <h3>Crafted/Intentional</h3>
    <p>Our product is crafted with care, marrying form and function into an experience that is sleek and modern. We measure the beauty of our product on the balance of aesthetics and function.</p>


    <h3>Sustainable</h3>
    <p>Our design is mindful of what has come before it and anticipates what will come after. The design framework should allow for harmonious growth and be built for inclusion. It should help ensure that the product experience is consistent and coherent throughout.</p>

    <h3>Revolutionary</h3>
    <p>Our product is powered by the energy and excitement of our users. They inspire us to be bold and to take risks in order to evolve the way stories are told.</p>
